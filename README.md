## Description
An Angular application to simulate the organization of a bar's beer inventory.

## Rules

**Objectives**
Build a small Angular app for a bar (or kombucha store) to track their kegs. Here are some user stories to get you started:

**patron**
1) As a patron, I want to see a list/menu of all available kegs.
  - For each keg, I need to see its name, brand, price and alcoholContent (or perhaps something like flavor for a kombucha store).
2) As a patron, I want to have kegs prices to be color-coded for easy readability.
  - Perhaps based on their price (greater or less than $5 per pint, perhaps) or the particular style of beer or kombucha.
3) As a patron, I want to use the alcohol content property to display stronger beers differently than weaker beers.

**employee**
1) As an employee, I want to fill out a form when I tap a new keg to add it to the list.
  - (Don't worry about authenticating employee user accounts yet.)
2) As an employee, I want the option to edit a keg's properties after entering them just in case I make a mistake.
3) As an employee, I want to be able to click a button next to a keg whenever I sell a pint of it. This should decrease the number of pints left by 1.
4) As an employee, I want to be able to see kegs with less than 10 pints left so I can be ready to change them.

**both**
1) As a patron and/or employee, I want to see how many pints are left in a keg. (Hint: A full keg has roughly 124 pints).

## Specifications

* Make abv show up as a specific shade based on %

* Make prices over $8 / pint show up as Magenta and under $8 show as Green

* Don't show a beer if the keg has no pints

* Implement beer description modal when beer is clicked on

* Add descriptions to beer (and a picture?)

* Implement "order" button on modal so customer can order a beer or close

* Implement subtraction of pints when clicked and bought

* Add a note to menu if a keg is low <--

* Implement pint subtraction from the appropriate keg when "order" button is clicked.

* Implement employee login (changes "Employee Login" to "Employee Use")

* Implement a modal for Employee Use

* Alert logged in employee when a keg is low

* Move Add Keg to employee modal

* Move Edit Keg to employee modal

* Do we need to make sure edited values don't reset? Add firebase?

* Pretty up the UI

* Refactor code as needed.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
